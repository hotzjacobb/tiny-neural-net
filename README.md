A tiny notebook personal project to code a neural net to solve XOR without external dependancies

## How to run?

There are no external dependencies apart from Python in the script, but you may need to install a package that allows you to run Python in an .ipynb file

Below are instructions

1. Open VSCode/Jupyter Notebook/your preferred notebook environment

2. Navigate to this directory on the command line, and run `setup.sh` which creates a virtual environment
    ```
    cd path_to_cloned_repo
    source setup.sh
    ```
3. If not automatically selected, in your notebook viewing application, set your Python kernel as `env/bin/python`. And restart before running.

4. Run in your notebook viewing app (preferably multiple times if you hit a local minimum) (:
